NEO, formerly Antshares, is China's first ever open source blockchain. Founded in 2014, NEOâ€™s mission has been to reinvent the way commerce is done. We believe technology drives progress and together we can create the future. Motivated by this, NEO has been created to shift our traditional economy into the new era of the Smart Economy.
